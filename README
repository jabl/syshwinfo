========================
syshwinfo release 2008.2
========================

This package contains a tool to find out information about a Linux system (OS
version, CPU, HD, etc.). The tool can be used directly or as a library. Also
supplied are a server and associated client agent that can be used to centrally
gather information about a number of clients.

Files included are:

``syshwinfo.py``
    The command-line tool and library to gather information about the system.

``hwinfoserver.py``
    XML-RPC server that listens for connections from agents and stores system information in a database.

``hwinforpc.cgi``
    CGI script for running hwinfoserver.py under a webserver.

``hwinfoagent.py``
    Agent that gathers system information and sends them to a server.

``hwinfo.cgi``
    CGI script that queries the database and returns it in CSV format.


Installation
============

Run ``python setup.py install``, or just copy the files wherever necessary. In
order to use the server+agent system you need to edit hwinfoserver.py to set
the DBFILE variable to point to where you want to store the database (a single
file in GNU DBM format). Secondly you need to edit hwinfoagent.py to point
SERVER to the URL of your server.
