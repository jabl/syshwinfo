========================
syshwinfo release 2008.4
========================

This package contains a tool to find out information about a Linux system (OS
version, CPU, HD, etc.). The tool can be used directly or as a library. Also
supplied are a server and associated client agent that can be used to centrally
gather information about a number of clients.

Files included are:

``syshwinfo.py`` 
    The command-line tool and library to gather information about
    the system. Optionally can be run in agent mode where it sends the system
    information to a server rather than printing it to the screen.

``hwinfoserver.py``
    XML-RPC server that listens for connections from agents and stores system
    information in a database.

``hwinforpc.cgi``
    CGI script for running hwinfoserver.py under a webserver.

``hwinfo.cgi``
    CGI script that queries the database and returns it in CSV format.


Installation
============

Run ``python setup.py install``, or just copy the files wherever necessary. In
order to use the server+agent system you can edit hwinfoserver.py to set the
DBFILE variable to point to where you want to store the database (a single file
in GNU DBM format). The default is in the current directory where the server is
run. Then run the syshwinfo.py script in agent mode, optionally giving it the
URL of the server, e.g. ``syshwinfo.py -a -s
http://192.168.0.1/path/to/hwinforpc.cgi``. The default URL is
``http://localhost:8000``, which is also the URL when hwinfoserver.py is
started directly from the command line without a web server.
